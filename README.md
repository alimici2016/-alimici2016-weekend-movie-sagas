# Movie SAGAS


## Description
This web application took about three days to complete.

This is web application that allows a user to make a personal list of movies. In this app users are able to submit new movies, delete new movies as well as updating previous inputs.

This application was the first time I used SAGA in an application of this magnitude, it was somewhat challenging to grasp the concept at first but now that I've completed this assignment I feel much better about it. This app also uses postgresql to store movies in a database, node.js for server routes, of course react/react-redux/redux-saga. Also some styling with material UI.
Was also able to briefly use the omdb API.

## Set up
-Fork and clone repository, then set up an set up a PostgreSQL database called saga_movies_weekend on port 5432.
-You can either copy paste data from the database.sql or load query once you load up postico.
-Npm install to get the dependencies, then npm run server, npm run client.
-This will take you to localhost 3000 where you should be able to view the application.
